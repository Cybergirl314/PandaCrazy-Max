PandaCrazy Chrome Extension for Amazon Mturk

This is a rebuild of my PandaCrazy userscript for Mturk.com in a Chrome Extension version. At this time it will work but with many options missing. Panda's can not be saved. There is no add button yet so have to add it in to the js/pandaCrazyMax.js file.
