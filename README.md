# PandaCrazy-Max
PandaCrazy Chrome Extension for Amazon Mturk

This is a rebuild of my PandaCrazy userscript for Mturk.com in a Chrome Extension version. At this time it will work but with many options missing. Panda's can not be saved but you can add panda's with the Add Job. Other buttons on menu's do not work at this time. Ham timers are not working but GoHam will work. This is being built by the newest ECMAScript, jquery, jquery UI and bootstrap. Coding in Visual Studio Code.

At this time this only works in Chrome in developer mode!
